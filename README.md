# Udemy Exercises on Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains coding exercises focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms**, specifically using **Linked Lists**. These exercises are part of my learning journey through Udemy, where I am building a deeper understanding of common Linked List operations.

## Linked List Methods Implemented

The following methods have been implemented as part of this series of exercises:

- `append`: Adds a new element to the end of the list.
- `pop`: Removes and returns the last element in the list.
- `prepend`: Adds a new element to the start of the list.
- `pop_first`: Removes and returns the first element in the list.
- `get`: Retrieves an element by its index.
- `set`: Updates an element at a specified index.
- `insert`: Inserts a new element at a specific position.
- `remove`: Removes an element by value.
- `reverse`: Reverses the order of elements in the list.
